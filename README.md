# ConeBot
A currency bot designed to handle multiple currencies in the same server. The bot is designed to give full power to the server administrators and allow them in depth control of how the currency goes around. 

## The bot is currently capable or plans to be capable of the following:
- [x] Adding new currencies.
- [x] Deleting currencies.
- [x] Checking the balance of all currencies for yourself.
- [x] Checking the balance of an individual currency for yourself.
- [x] Checking someone else's balance.
- [x] Commands for admins to manually add or substract currencies
- [ ] Check permissions of people to see if they can run admin commands.
- [ ] Help command (very hard)
- [ ] Make bot available to public (it probably is if you are reading this).
- [ ] Earn currency from chatting, with toggles for roles and channels.
- [ ] Make all commands toggleable.
- [ ] Allow users to transfer currency to eachother.
- [ ] Exchange currencies between eachother if admins allow it to.
- [ ] Syncronise specific currencies cross-server if they mutually agree.
- [ ] Item shop similar to unbelievaboat.
- [ ] Documentation on how to setup the bot for your own use and covering commands in more detail.

I did not see any bot that allows for such currency management. Closest one is Unbelievaboat but it does not allow for multiple currencies.

This bot is under the AGPL license because I do not anyone making modifications for the good and not releasing it to the public by just running it on their server. The license states that if the code is ran on a network it must be open sourced.
